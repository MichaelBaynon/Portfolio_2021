      <p>I have been writing code for about 2 & 1/2 years now.</p>

        My work experience varies in field to specific job title/responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked with both

      </p>
      <p>I have also contributed to a small blockchain startup.</p>
      <p>
        Currently I work for Trilogy Education Services as a Teaching Assistant,
        Tutor, Grader, and Learning Assistant.

      <h1>How was I educated?</h1>
      <p>
        After some time of self study and learning I decided I loved coding and
        the world of software engineering and decided to pursue it further.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result I attended
        <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/" target="_">Lambda School.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Lambda School is a 9+ month Computer Science & Software Engineering
        Academy that provides an immersive hands-on curriculum with a focus on
        computer science, web and mobile development, UX design, and data
        science.
      </p>
      <p>
        While at Lambda School I learned many things. I learned the basics like
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then learned more specific things like React, Express, Node, and SQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way we created some applications in groups of all varying
        sizes and makeups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of our projects were made up entirely of software engineer students
        and other projects had both UX/UI and Data Science students working
        along side us.
      </p>
      <p>
        This course taught me how to work along side others of both my
        speciality and others. I left Lambda School much more knowledgeable then
        I came and I felt much more confident working with others and delivering
        something genuinly worth while.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>How can I help you?</h1>
      <p>Now for the most important part.</p>
      <p>Since I have left Lambda School I have not stopped learning.</p>
      <p>I am now happy to present a large set of skills that I have.</p>
      <p>
        Since Lambda School I have learned React Native and made some mobile
        applications using it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have really jumped into Bootstrap and now I have both a real respect
        for it and also vanilla CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also took the time to learn Vue in part for my contracts with both
        eBay and Xfinity/Comcast.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have jumped into the basics of PHP, Python, and even blockchain
        development. By no means am I a master of these 3 but I am fairly
        familiar with them and I am confident I can get proficient with them
        rather quickly.
      </p>
      <h3>So for a summarized version of all my current skills</h3>
      <ul class="skillList">
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Bootstrap</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>React Native</li>
        <li>Vue</li>
        <li>Node</li>
        <li>Express</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With all of these technical skills. In addition to my soft skills
        including 2 years worth of remote working experience, cross-skill
        collaboration, general computer hardware knowledge, and general people
        skills.
      </p>
      <p>I am confident I can make an impact at your organization.</p>

    <div>
      <h1>Why am I looking for a new opportunity?</h1>
      <p>
        Currently I work nights mostly or odd hours because these are the hours
        students have to get their education.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to this strange scheduling I am open during the standard work day.
      </p>
      <p>But why am I truly looking for a new opportunity?</p>
      <p>
        It is simple. I have done the teaching and now it is time for me to
        return to creating. While I do love my job I do find myself thinking
        about my past contracts and how I miss the feeling of creating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't get me wrong I still get the feeling from time to time while
        teaching but I crave it more then ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason I am looking for a new company to take my skills to and
        make an impact as soon as possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Lastly (I promise), What am I looking for in a company?</h1>
      <p>
        I am looking for a stable, well established company that is ambitious
        and creating something awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
        A company that employees can be proud to work at and leave work everyday
        feeling they have truly done a good days work.
